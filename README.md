# Lightgraph

## What It Is

Lightgraph is a graph-native lighting engine for installations that are not just straight LED strips.

It treats a lighting piece as a connected structure and lets light move through that structure as if it were a spatial system. You can think in terms of flow, branching, and movement across a sculpture, facade, or 3D object, instead of programming each strip as an isolated line.

It solves a common problem in advanced LED work: once a project has intersections, loops, branches, and non-linear geometry, traditional strip-first tooling becomes hard to manage. Lightgraph gives you a single abstraction for those layouts.

Unlike WLED and most strip-first systems, the primary model here is not a set of channels, but a connected light network. What makes that conceptually interesting is that physical form is no longer separate from animation logic: the shape of the installation directly influences how light behaves.

## Core Concept

The core idea is simple:

- Your LED installation is modeled as a graph (a mesh of connected segments).
- Intersections are nodes.
- LED segments between intersections are edges.
- Light events travel through this graph over time.

This means animation is no longer limited to left-to-right strip playback. Instead, motion can route through arbitrary topology, making the installation itself part of the composition logic.

Conceptually, Lightgraph is interesting because the physical structure is not just where pixels live, it becomes part of how behavior is generated.

### Topology Building Blocks

- `Intersection`: a junction where light arrives and a next direction is chosen.
- `Connection`: a path segment between two intersections, mapped to a run of LEDs.
- `Bridge`: a convenience way to create a simple path between two pixel endpoints (it creates the endpoints and links them).
- `Model` (with `Weight`s): a routing profile that defines how likely each outgoing path is at a junction, so you can shape flow behavior instead of hard-coding one route.

## Why It's Different

WLED and most traditional LED strip workflows are optimized for linear channels and fixture maps. They are excellent for many practical systems, but the mental model is still largely strip-based.

Lightgraph is topology-based.

- In strip-first systems, geometry is often something you work around.
- In Lightgraph, geometry is the primary input.
- In strip-first systems, complex routing often means custom glue code.
- In Lightgraph, routing through branches and intersections is built into the model.

So instead of coordinating many strips manually, you program one connected light space.

## Example Use Cases

- LED sculpture: route light through branching metal or acrylic structures where direction and junction behavior matter.
- 3D installations: drive volumetric pieces where motion should move through depth, not just across a flat map.
- Architectural lighting: treat corridors, columns, and facade segments as a connected lighting network.
- Generative light art: build systems where the topology itself influences emergent visual behavior.

## How It Works (High Level)

At a high level, Lightgraph does four things:

1. Defines a connected lighting topology.
2. Accepts light events (speed, color, length, behavior).
3. Advances those events through the topology over time.
4. Produces per-pixel RGB output for your host runtime.

The engine is host-agnostic, so it can sit behind firmware, desktop tools, simulators, or custom control software.

## Quickstart (Stable API)

```cpp
#include <lightgraph/lightgraph.hpp>

int main() {
    lightgraph::EngineConfig config;
    config.object_type = lightgraph::ObjectType::Line;
    config.pixel_count = 64;

    lightgraph::Engine engine(config);

    lightgraph::EmitCommand emit;
    emit.model = 0;
    emit.length = 8;
    emit.speed = 1.0f;
    emit.color = 0x33CC99;

    const auto emitted = engine.emit(emit);
    if (!emitted) {
        return 1;
    }

    engine.tick(16);

    const auto p0 = engine.pixel(0);
    if (!p0) {
        return 1;
    }

    const lightgraph::Color color = p0.value();
    return (color.r || color.g || color.b) ? 0 : 1;
}
```

A compiling example is provided in `examples/minimal_usage.cpp`.
For source-level topology/runtime integration, see `examples/integration_host_loop.cpp`.

## Built-in Topology Objects

The codebase currently defines these topology objects:

- `Heptagon919`: 919-pixel heptagon/star layout with multiple routing models.
- `Heptagon3024`: 3024-pixel heptagon/star layout with explicit gap mapping for non-LED spans.
- `Line`: a single-loop line topology with default and bounce routing models.
- `Cross`: intersecting horizontal/vertical paths with directional model variants.
- `Triangle`: three-sided topology with clockwise/counter-clockwise behavior models.
- `HeptagonStar`: shared base topology used by the `Heptagon919` and `Heptagon3024` specializations (source-integration layer).

For the stable high-level `lightgraph::Engine` API, currently supported `ObjectType` values are:
`Heptagon919`, `Heptagon3024`, `Line`, `Cross`, and `Triangle`.

## Defining New Topologies

To add a new object topology:

1. Create `src/objects/<YourObject>.h` and `.cpp` with a class that inherits `TopologyObject`.
2. In the constructor, pass `pixelCount` to `TopologyObject(pixelCount)` and call `setup()`.
3. In `setup()`, define structure with `addIntersection(...)`, `addConnection(...)`, and optional `addBridge(...)`.
4. Add routing behavior with one or more `Model` instances and set per-path `Weight`s via `model->put(...)`.
5. Optionally override helpers like `getModelParams(...)`, `getParams(...)`, and mirror behavior methods.
6. Expose the object through integration/stable APIs (as needed). For integration, update
   `include/lightgraph/integration/objects.hpp` and `include/lightgraph/integration/factory.hpp`.
   For stable engine support, update `include/lightgraph/types.hpp` (`ObjectType`) and
   `src/api/Engine.cpp` (object factory switch).

Minimal scaffold:

```cpp
class MyObject : public TopologyObject {
  public:
    explicit MyObject(uint16_t pixelCount) : TopologyObject(pixelCount) { setup(); }

    EmitParams getModelParams(int model) const override {
        return EmitParams(model, Random::randomSpeed());
    }

  private:
    void setup() {
        Model::maxWeights = 2;
        Model* base = addModel(new Model(0, 10, GROUP1));

        Connection* bridge = addBridge(pixelCount - 1, 0, GROUP1);
        Connection* segment =
            addConnection(new Connection(bridge->to, bridge->from, GROUP1, pixelCount - 3));

        base->put(bridge, 0);
        base->put(segment, 10);
    }
};
```

## Technical Reference

### API Layout

Lightgraph provides two header tiers:

- Stable installable API:
  - `lightgraph/lightgraph.hpp`
  - `lightgraph/engine.hpp`
  - `lightgraph/types.hpp`
  - `lightgraph/status.hpp`
  - `lightgraph/version.hpp`
- Source-integration module headers (for in-repo integrations like [MeshLED](https://github.com/kasparsj/meshled)):
  - `lightgraph/integration.hpp`
  - `lightgraph/integration/topology.hpp`
  - `lightgraph/integration/runtime.hpp`
  - `lightgraph/integration/rendering.hpp`
  - `lightgraph/integration/objects.hpp`
  - `lightgraph/integration/factory.hpp`
  - `lightgraph/integration/debug.hpp`

The stable install/export package installs only the stable API headers.
Source-integration headers are build-tree only and are intentionally exposed
through a separate CMake target: `lightgraph::integration`.
